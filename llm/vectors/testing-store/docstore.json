Don't be afraid to become a part of action, but as a photographer, you should be invisible.\n- Do take street portraits. Ask people if you can take their picture. If they say no, respect their wishes and move on.\n- It is more important to capture an image that tells a story than for that image to be technically perfect.","metadata":{"id":0}}],["1",{"pageContent":"## Wear Your Camera as an Accessory\nGoal: Become more confident with your camera in public\n\n- Wear your camera around your neck for a week in public, not to take photos, but to get accustomed to the new look.\n\n## Reduce The Frame\nGoal: Focus on essential objects in the frame to tell a cohesive story\n\n- Inspect every object in the frame, and if it's not necessary, eliminate it by going closer or altering the angle.\n\n## One Arm Challenge\nGoal: Get closer to subjects, overcome social anxiety, and become \"invisible\"\n\n- Take images only from subjects that are one arm-length away, with a fixed focal length around 35mm or less. Move fast and get close without disturbing the candid scene.\n\n## Standing in One Place\nGoal: Become more invisible and work a scene thoroughly\n\n- Stand in one place with high pedestrian traffic, observe and adapt to the situation, and take photos.\n\n## 51 Images\nGoal: Push your limits and stay focused on capturing images\n\n- Force yourself to take 51 images during your next street photography session without a break.\n\n## Same Camera & Lens Combination\nGoal: Improve your photography skills instead of focusing on gear\n\n- Use the same camera and lens for a month, without switching to other gear.\n\n## Switch to Color or B&W\nGoal: Explore different styles of photography and expand your skills\n\n- If you mainly shoot in B&W, switch to color, and vice versa. Learn how different styles impact your photography.\n\n## Donâ€™t Look at Your Images Immediately\nGoal: Gain a more neutral view and objective judgment of your images\n\n- Avoid looking at your images immediately after taking them. Let them \"ripen\" for a few weeks or months before reviewing and editing.\n\n## Post 5 \"Failures\" on Social Media\nGoal: Overcome the pressure to conform to a specific style on social media\n\n- Post 5 images that you consider failures or that deviate from your usual style on social media. Focus on personal satisfaction rather than gaining likes.","metadata":{"id":1}}],["2",{"pageContent":"{\n  \"name\": \"Photography Tutor\",\n  \"questions\": [\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What is aperture and how does it affect my photos?\",\n      \"thoughts\": \"Aperture refers to the size of the opening within the lens that determines how much light reaches the sensor. A larger numbed, counterintuitively, means less light. A smaller number means more light. Because of some complicated physics, more a smaller aperture results in a smaller amount of the subject being photograped to be in focus. When you see pictures that show a beautiful blurry background with a subject that's nice and sharp, this is the result of a lower aperture number. Conversely, when you see a photo that has sharp focus from back to front, this is the result of a smaller aperture. How to remember: a smaller number means a smaller amount will be in focus.

For example, 1/250 means the shutter will be open for 4 milliseconds. 1/25 means the shutter will be open for 40 milliseconds. 1/4 means the shutter will be open for 250 milliseconds, or, a quarter of a second. Shutter speed, like aperture, is a creative choice. For \\\"freezing\\\" motion. a higer shutter speed is neccesary.

In the easiest to understand terms, ISO refers to how sensitive the sensor in your camera is. Lower numbers mean lower sensitivity, and higher numbers mean higher sensitivity. Generally speaking, lower numbers are better because they will produce less unsightly noise in your images. Cameras have gotten really good at mitigating this noise compared to digital cameras of years-past, however, you want to ensure that you're using the appropriate ISO for the lighting conditions you're seeing. For example, on a gloomy, cloudy day, to get an appropriate exposure at 1/250s, at an aperture of f5.6, you will require a higher ISO (800 for example) that you will on a bright, sunny day. ISO should generally be your final choice.

If you are shooting RAW instead of JPEG, white balance is less of a concern because it is easily fixed later. However, understanding white balance is key to producing images that are of high quality and pleasing to the eye. An incorrect white balance will give your photos an unnatural look, ruin skin tones, or otherwise make for an unnatural image. White balance is expressed in temperature numbers: Candlelight: 1900, Incandescent light: 2700, Sunrise/golden hour: 2800 to 3000, Halogen lamps: 3000, Moonlight: 4100, White LEDs: 4500, Mid-day Sun: 5000 to 5500, Flash: 5500, Overcast/cloudy: 6500 to 7500, Shade: 8000, Heavy cloud cover: 9000 to 10000, Blue sky: 10000.

Much of photography is very technical, whereas composition is truly the art in the art form. Don't be daunted, however as good rules of composition -- for you to leverage, or break -- do exist, and you can train your eye as they say to shoot great images. These rules exist because of the way our brain processes the images we see. When we are walking around in the world, our brains are doing a lot of image processing... Including and excluding details that are or are not important. When we look at a static image, however, our brains don't process them in quite the same way, and so giving the brain the clues it needs to prioritize what it sees is up to the photographer. \",\n      \"autoGenerated\": false\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What is the difference between RAW and JPEG files?\",","metadata":{"id":5}}],["6",{"pageContent":"\"autoGenerated\": false\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What is the difference between RAW and JPEG files?\",\n      \"thoughts\": \"Ah the old RAW vs JPEG debate.

You asked though, so I'll answer. RAW files contain as much of the original light that hit the sensor as is technically possible. JPEG photos are compressed using a lossy format and as such, while the cameras today provide _gorgeous_ JPEG image processing, once the data is thrown away, it's gone forever. Shoot in raw.

Landscape photos are so often about the details in the landscape your photographing, and light that comes from overhead is usually a recipe for *really* boring landscapes. Conversely, light that is coming from a lower angle, especially from one side, will create depth in the landscape and that's what creates a sense of scale.

Images in which the subject and the photographer are connected are far more intimate and engaging than those where they were not. This is, of course, different for candid photography or street photography in which you are shooting as an observer. In any case, shooting people requires that lighting be a big part of the story. Avoid overhead harsh lighting as this will create deep shadows in the eye sockets. Shooting in direct sunlight is quite challenging, so try to shoot in the shade when possible. If your only choice is out in the direct sun, avoid the sun at it's peak (between 11-1, generally speaking) and if possible, shoot with the sun behind them so that they are creating a shadow for their face with their own head.
