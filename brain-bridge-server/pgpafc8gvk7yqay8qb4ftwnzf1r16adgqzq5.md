Meet the Team[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
===================================================

React development is led by a dedicated team working full time at Meta. It also receives contributions from people all over the world.

React Core[](#react-core "Link for React Core ")
------------------------------------------------

The React Core team members work full time on the core component APIs, the engine that powers React DOM and React Native, React DevTools, and the React documentation website.

Current members of the React team are listed in alphabetical order below.

### Jason Bonta[](#jason-bonta "Link for Jason Bonta")

Engineering Manager at Meta

Jason likes having large volumes of Amazon packages delivered to the office so that he can build forts. Despite literally walling himself off from his team at times and not understanding how for-of loops work, we appreciate him for the unique qualities he brings to his work.

### Josh Story[](#josh-story "Link for Josh Story")

Engineer at Vercel

Josh majored in Mathematics and discovered programming while in college. His first professional developer job was to program insurance rate calculations in Microsoft Excel, the paragon of Reactive Programming which must be why he now works on React. In between that time Josh has been an IC, Manager, and Executive at a few startups. outside of work he likes to push his limits with cooking.

### Luna Ruan[](#luna-ruan "Link for Luna Ruan")

Independent Engineer

Luna learned programming because she thought it meant creating video games. Instead, she ended up working on the Pinterest web app, and now on React itself. Luna doesn’t want to make video games anymore, but she plans to do creative writing if she ever gets bored.

### Mengdi Chen[](#mengdi-chen "Link for Mengdi Chen")

Engineer at Meta

While working on his Digital Arts degree Mengdi was conceited about his front-end skills because his CSS worked perfectly even on IE6. But soon React opened a new door of programming for him, and he has been dreaming of joining the React team ever since. Outside of work, he is usually busy chasing his two kids around or collecting strange recipes.

### Sean Keegan[](#sean-keegan "Link for Sean Keegan")

Developer Advocate at Meta

After a first career as a math teacher, Sean remembered that one intro to comp sci class he had to take as a prereq and thought “that was kind of fun!”. One coding bootcamp and several tech jobs later, Sean discovered developer advocacy and hasn’t looked back. Outside of work, Sean enjoys ultimate frisbee, video games, and researching (but rarely implementing) better ways to care for his houseplants.

### Sebastian Markbåge[](#sebastian-markb%C3%A5ge "Link for Sebastian Markbåge")

Engineer at Vercel

Sebastian majored in psychology. He’s usually quiet. Even when he says something, it often doesn’t make sense to the rest of us until a few months later. The correct way to pronounce his surname is “mark-boa-geh” but he settled for “mark-beige” out of pragmatism — and that’s how he approaches React.

### Sebastian Silbermann[](#sebastian-silbermann "Link for Sebastian Silbermann")

Independent Engineer

Sebastian learned programming to make the browser games he played during class more enjoyable. Eventually this lead to contributing to as much open source code as possible. Outside of coding he’s busy making sure people don’t confuse him with the other Sebastians and Zilberman of the React community.

### Seth Webster[](#seth-webster "Link for Seth Webster")

Engineering Manager at Meta

Seth started programming as a kid growing up in Tucson, AZ. After school, he was bitten by the music bug and was a touring musician for about 10 years before returning to _work_, starting with Intuit. In his spare time, he loves [taking pictures](https://www.sethwebster.com) and flying for animal rescues in the northeastern United States.

### Sophie Alpert[](#sophie-alpert "Link for Sophie Alpert")

Independent Engineer

Four days after React was released, Sophie rewrote the entirety of her then-current project to use it, which she now realizes was perhaps a bit reckless. After she became the project’s #1 committer, she wondered why she wasn’t getting paid by Facebook like everyone else was and joined the team officially to lead React through its adolescent years. Though she quit that job years ago, somehow she’s still in the team’s group chats and “providing value”.

### Tianyu Yao[](#tianyu-yao "Link for Tianyu Yao")

Engineer at Meta

Tianyu’s interest in computers started as a kid because he loves video games. So he majored in computer science and still plays childish games like League of Legends. When he is not in front of a computer, he enjoys playing with his two kittens, hiking and kayaking.

### Yuzhi Zheng[](#yuzhi-zheng "Link for Yuzhi Zheng")

Engineering Manager at Meta

Yuzhi studied Computer Science in school. She liked the instant gratification of seeing code come to life without having to physically be in a laboratory. Now she’s a manager in the React org. Before management, she used to work on the Relay data fetching framework. In her spare time, Yuzhi enjoys optimizing her life via gardening and home improvement projects.
