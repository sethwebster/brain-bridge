Passing Props to a Component[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
==================================================================

React components use _props_ to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.

### You will learn

*   How to pass props to a component
*   How to read props from a component
*   How to specify default values for props
*   How to pass some JSX to a component
*   How props change over time

Familiar props[](#familiar-props "Link for Familiar props ")
------------------------------------------------------------

Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag. For example, `className`, `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height` are some of the props you can pass to an `<img>`:

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined "Open in CodeSandbox")

function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className\="avatar"
      src\="https://i.imgur.com/1bX5QH6.jpg"
      alt\="Lin Lanying"
      width\=
      height\=
    />
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar />
  );
}

The props you can pass to an `<img>` tag are predefined (ReactDOM conforms to [the HTML standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/semantics-embedded-content.html#the-img-element)). But you can pass any props to _your own_ components, such as `<Avatar>`, to customize them. Here‚Äôs how!

Passing props to a component[](#passing-props-to-a-component "Link for Passing props to a component ")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this code, the `Profile` component isn‚Äôt passing any props to its child component, `Avatar`:

    export default function Profile() 

You can give `Avatar` some props in two steps.

### Step 1: Pass props to the child component[](#step-1-pass-props-to-the-child-component "Link for Step 1: Pass props to the child component ")

First, pass some props to `Avatar`. For example, let‚Äôs pass two props: `person` (an object), and `size` (a number):

    export default function Profile() 

### Note

If double curly braces after `person=` confuse you, recall [they‚Äôre merely an object](javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces.html#using-double-curlies-css-and-other-objects-in-jsx) inside the JSX curlies.

Now you can read these props inside the `Avatar` component.

### Step 2: Read props inside the child component[](#step-2-read-props-inside-the-child-component "Link for Step 2: Read props inside the child component ")

You can read these props by listing their names `person, size` separated by the commas inside `()` directly after `function Avatar`. This lets you use them inside the `Avatar` code, like you would with a variable.

    function Avatar(

Add some logic to `Avatar` that uses the `person` and `size` props for rendering, and you‚Äôre done.

Now you can configure `Avatar` to render in many different ways with different props. Try tweaking the values!

App.jsutils.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined "Open in CodeSandbox")

import  from './utils.js';

function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className\="avatar"
      src\=
      alt\=
      width\=
      height\=
    />
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <div\>
      <Avatar
        size\=
        person\={{ 
          name: 'Katsuko Saruhashi', 
          imageId: 'YfeOqp2'
        }}
      />
      <Avatar
        size\=
        person\={{
          name: 'Aklilu Lemma', 
          imageId: 'OKS67lh'
        }}
      />
      <Avatar
        size\=
        person\={{ 
          name: 'Lin Lanying',
          imageId: '1bX5QH6'
        }}
      />
    </div\>
  );
}

Props let you think about parent and child components independently. For example, you can change the `person` or the `size` props inside `Profile` without having to think about how `Avatar` uses them. Similarly, you can change how the `Avatar` uses these props, without looking at the `Profile`.

You can think of props like ‚Äúknobs‚Äù that you can adjust. They serve the same role as arguments serve for functions‚Äîin fact, props _are_ the only argument to your component! React component functions accept a single argument, a `props` object:

    function Avatar(props) 

Usually you don‚Äôt need the whole `props` object itself, so you destructure it into individual props.

### Pitfall

**Don‚Äôt miss the pair of `` curlies** inside of `(` and `)` when declaring props:

    function Avatar(

This syntax is called [‚Äúdestructuring‚Äù](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Unpacking_fields_from_objects_passed_as_a_function_parameter) and is equivalent to reading properties from a function parameter:

    function Avatar(props) 

Specifying a default value for a prop[](#specifying-a-default-value-for-a-prop "Link for Specifying a default value for a prop ")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to give a prop a default value to fall back on when no value is specified, you can do it with the destructuring by putting `=` and the default value right after the parameter:

    function Avatar(

Now, if `<Avatar person= />` is rendered with no `size` prop, the `size` will be set to `100`.

The default value is only used if the `size` prop is missing or if you pass `size=`, the default value will **not** be used.

Forwarding props with the JSX spread syntax[](#forwarding-props-with-the-jsx-spread-syntax "Link for Forwarding props with the JSX spread syntax ")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, passing props gets very repetitive:

    function Profile(

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with repetitive code‚Äîit can be more legible. But at times you may value conciseness. Some components forward all of their props to their children, like how this `Profile` does with `Avatar`. Because they don‚Äôt use any of their props directly, it can make sense to use a more concise ‚Äúspread‚Äù syntax:

    function Profile(props) 

This forwards all of `Profile`‚Äôs props to the `Avatar` without listing each of their names.

**Use spread syntax with restraint.** If you‚Äôre using it in every other component, something is wrong. Often, it indicates that you should split your components and pass children as JSX. More on that next!

Passing JSX as children[](#passing-jsx-as-children "Link for Passing JSX as children ")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is common to nest built-in browser tags:

    <div>  <img /></div>

Sometimes you‚Äôll want to nest your own components the same way:

    <Card>  <Avatar /></Card>

When you nest content inside a JSX tag, the parent component will receive that content in a prop called `children`. For example, the `Card` component below will receive a `children` prop set to `<Avatar />` and render it in a wrapper div:

App.jsAvatar.jsutils.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined "Open in CodeSandbox")

import Avatar from './Avatar.js';

function Card() {
  return (
    <div className\="card"\>
      
    </div\>
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Card\>
      <Avatar
        size\=
        person\={{ 
          name: 'Katsuko Saruhashi',
          imageId: 'YfeOqp2'
        }}
      />
    </Card\>
  );
}

Show more

Try replacing the `<Avatar>` inside `<Card>` with some text to see how the `Card` component can wrap any nested content. It doesn‚Äôt need to ‚Äúknow‚Äù what‚Äôs being rendered inside of it. You will see this flexible pattern in many places.

You can think of a component with a `children` prop as having a ‚Äúhole‚Äù that can be ‚Äúfilled in‚Äù by its parent components with arbitrary JSX. You will often use the `children` prop for visual wrappers: panels, grids, etc.

How props change over time[](#how-props-change-over-time "Link for How props change over time ")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `Clock` component below receives two props from its parent component: `color` and `time`. (The parent component‚Äôs code is omitted because it uses [state](state-a-components-memory.html), which we won‚Äôt dive into just yet.)

Try changing the color in the select box below:

Clock.js

Clock.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined "Open in CodeSandbox")

export default function Clock() {
  return (
    <h1 style\=\>
      
    </h1\>
  );
}

This example illustrates that **a component may receive different props over time.** Props are not always static! Here, the `time` prop changes every second, and the `color` prop changes when you select another color. Props reflect a component‚Äôs data at any point in time, rather than only in the beginning.

However, props are [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object)‚Äîa term from computer science meaning ‚Äúunchangeable‚Äù. When a component needs to change its props (for example, in response to a user interaction or new data), it will have to ‚Äúask‚Äù its parent component to pass it _different props_‚Äîa new object! Its old props will then be cast aside, and eventually the JavaScript engine will reclaim the memory taken by them.

**Don‚Äôt try to ‚Äúchange props‚Äù.** When you need to respond to the user input (like changing the selected color), you will need to ‚Äúset state‚Äù, which you can learn about in [State: A Component‚Äôs Memory.](state-a-components-memory.html)

Recap[](#recap "Link for Recap")
--------------------------------

*   To pass props, add them to the JSX, just like you would with HTML attributes.
*   To read props, use the `function Avatar()` destructuring syntax.
*   You can specify a default value like `size = 100`, which is used for missing and `undefined` props.
*   You can forward all props with `<Avatar  />` JSX spread syntax, but don‚Äôt overuse it!
*   Nested JSX like `<Card><Avatar /></Card>` will appear as `Card` component‚Äôs `children` prop.
*   Props are read-only snapshots in time: every render receives a new version of props.
*   You can‚Äôt change props. When you need interactivity, you‚Äôll need to set state.
