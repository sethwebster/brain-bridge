React Canaries: Incremental Feature Rollout Outside Meta
--------------------------------------------------------

May 3, 2023

Traditionally, new React features used to only be available at Meta first, and land in the open source releases later. Weâ€™d like to offer the React community an option to adopt individual new features as soon as their design is close to finalâ€”similar to how Meta uses React internally.

React Labs: What We've Been Working On â€“ June 2022
--------------------------------------------------

June 15, 2022

React 18 was years in the making, and with it brought valuable lessons for the React team. Its release was the result of many years of research and exploring many paths. Some of those paths were successful; many more were dead-ends that led to new insights. One lesson weâ€™ve learned is that itâ€™s frustrating for the community to wait for new features without having insight into these paths that weâ€™re exploringâ€¦
