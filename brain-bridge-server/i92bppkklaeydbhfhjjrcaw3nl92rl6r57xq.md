Thinking in React[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
=======================================================

React can change how you think about the designs you look at and the apps you build. When you build a user interface with React, you will first break it apart into pieces called _components_. Then, you will describe the different visual states for each of your components. Finally, you will connect your components together so that the data flows through them. In this tutorial, we‚Äôll guide you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table with React.

Start with the mockup[](#start-with-the-mockup "Link for Start with the mockup ")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine that you already have a JSON API and a mockup from a designer.

The JSON API returns some data that looks like this:

    [  ]

The mockup looks like this:

![](../images/docs/s_thinking-in-react_ui.png)

To implement a UI in React, you will usually follow the same five steps.

Step 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy[](#step-1-break-the-ui-into-a-component-hierarchy "Link for Step 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy ")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Start by drawing boxes around every component and subcomponent in the mockup and naming them. If you work with a designer, they may have already named these components in their design tool. Ask them!

Depending on your background, you can think about splitting up a design into components in different ways:

*   **Programming**‚Äîuse the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
*   **CSS**‚Äîconsider what you would make class selectors for. (However, components are a bit less granular.)
*   **Design**‚Äîconsider how you would organize the design‚Äôs layers.

If your JSON is well-structured, you‚Äôll often find that it naturally maps to the component structure of your UI. That‚Äôs because UI and data models often have the same information architecture‚Äîthat is, the same shape. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.

There are five components on this screen:

![](../images/docs/s_thinking-in-react_ui_outline.png)

1.  `FilterableProductTable` (grey) contains the entire app.
2.  `SearchBar` (blue) receives the user input.
3.  `ProductTable` (lavender) displays and filters the list according to the user input.
4.  `ProductCategoryRow` (green) displays a heading for each category.
5.  `ProductRow` (yellow) displays a row for each product.

If you look at `ProductTable` (lavender), you‚Äôll see that the table header (containing the ‚ÄúName‚Äù and ‚ÄúPrice‚Äù labels) isn‚Äôt its own component. This is a matter of preference, and you could go either way. For this example, it is a part of `ProductTable` because it appears inside the `ProductTable`‚Äôs list. However, if this header grows to be complex (e.g., if you add sorting), you can move it into its own `ProductTableHeader` component.

Now that you‚Äôve identified the components in the mockup, arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mockup should appear as a child in the hierarchy:

*   `FilterableProductTable`
    *   `SearchBar`
    *   `ProductTable`
        *   `ProductCategoryRow`
        *   `ProductRow`

Step 2: Build a static version in React[](#step-2-build-a-static-version-in-react "Link for Step 2: Build a static version in React ")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have your component hierarchy, it‚Äôs time to implement your app. The most straightforward approach is to build a version that renders the UI from your data model without adding any interactivity‚Ä¶ yet! It‚Äôs often easier to build the static version first and add interactivity later. Building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, but adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.

To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you‚Äôll want to build [components](your-first-component.html) that reuse other components and pass data using [props.](passing-props-to-a-component.html) Props are a way of passing data from parent to child. (If you‚Äôre familiar with the concept of [state](state-a-components-memory.html), don‚Äôt use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don‚Äôt need it.)

You can either build ‚Äútop down‚Äù by starting with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (like `FilterableProductTable`) or ‚Äúbottom up‚Äù by working from components lower down (like `ProductRow`). In simpler examples, it‚Äôs usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it‚Äôs easier to go bottom-up.

After building your components, you‚Äôll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. Because this is a static app, the components will only return JSX. The component at the top of the hierarchy (`FilterableProductTable`) will take your data model as a prop. This is called _one-way data flow_ because the data flows down from the top-level component to the ones at the bottom of the tree.

### Pitfall

At this point, you should not be using any state values. That‚Äôs for the next step!

Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state[](#step-3-find-the-minimal-but-complete-representation-of-ui-state "Link for Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state ")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To make the UI interactive, you need to let users change your underlying data model. You will use _state_ for this.

Think of state as the minimal set of changing data that your app needs to remember. The most important principle for structuring state is to keep it [DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else on-demand. For example, if you‚Äôre building a shopping list, you can store the items as an array in state. If you want to also display the number of items in the list, don‚Äôt store the number of items as another state value‚Äîinstead, read the length of your array.

Now think of all of the pieces of data in this example application:

1.  The original list of products
2.  The search text the user has entered
3.  The value of the checkbox
4.  The filtered list of products

Which of these are state? Identify the ones that are not:

*   Does it **remain unchanged** over time? If so, it isn‚Äôt state.
*   Is it **passed in from a parent** via props? If so, it isn‚Äôt state.
*   **Can you compute it** based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it _definitely_ isn‚Äôt state!

What‚Äôs left is probably state.

Let‚Äôs go through them one by one again:

1.  The original list of products is **passed in as props, so it‚Äôs not state.**
2.  The search text seems to be state since it changes over time and can‚Äôt be computed from anything.
3.  The value of the checkbox seems to be state since it changes over time and can‚Äôt be computed from anything.
4.  The filtered list of products **isn‚Äôt state because it can be computed** by taking the original list of products and filtering it according to the search text and value of the checkbox.

This means only the search text and the value of the checkbox are state! Nicely done!

##### Deep Dive

#### Props vs State[](#props-vs-state "Link for Props vs State ")

Show Details

There are two types of ‚Äúmodel‚Äù data in React: props and state. The two are very different:

*   [**Props** are like arguments you pass](passing-props-to-a-component.html) to a function. They let a parent component pass data to a child component and customize its appearance. For example, a `Form` can pass a `color` prop to a `Button`.
*   [**State** is like a component‚Äôs memory.](state-a-components-memory.html) It lets a component keep track of some information and change it in response to interactions. For example, a `Button` might keep track of `isHovered` state.

Props and state are different, but they work together. A parent component will often keep some information in state (so that it can change it), and _pass it down_ to child components as their props. It‚Äôs okay if the difference still feels fuzzy on the first read. It takes a bit of practice for it to really stick!

Step 4: Identify where your state should live[](#step-4-identify-where-your-state-should-live "Link for Step 4: Identify where your state should live ")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After identifying your app‚Äôs minimal state data, you need to identify which component is responsible for changing this state, or _owns_ the state. Remember: React uses one-way data flow, passing data down the component hierarchy from parent to child component. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. This can be challenging if you‚Äôre new to this concept, but you can figure it out by following these steps!

For each piece of state in your application:

1.  Identify _every_ component that renders something based on that state.
2.  Find their closest common parent component‚Äîa component above them all in the hierarchy.
3.  Decide where the state should live:
    1.  Often, you can put the state directly into their common parent.
    2.  You can also put the state into some component above their common parent.
    3.  If you can‚Äôt find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent component.

In the previous step, you found two pieces of state in this application: the search input text, and the value of the checkbox. In this example, they always appear together, so it makes sense to put them into the same place.

Now let‚Äôs run through our strategy for them:

1.  **Identify components that use state:**
    *   `ProductTable` needs to filter the product list based on that state (search text and checkbox value).
    *   `SearchBar` needs to display that state (search text and checkbox value).
2.  **Find their common parent:** The first parent component both components share is `FilterableProductTable`.
3.  **Decide where the state lives**: We‚Äôll keep the filter text and checked state values in `FilterableProductTable`.

So the state values will live in `FilterableProductTable`.

Add state to the component with the [`useState()` Hook.](../reference/react/useState.html) Hooks are special functions that let you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React. Add two state variables at the top of `FilterableProductTable` and specify their initial state:

    function FilterableProductTable() {  const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState('');  const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false);

Then, pass `filterText` and `inStockOnly` to `ProductTable` and `SearchBar` as props:

    <div>  <SearchBar     filterText= /></div>

You can start seeing how your application will behave. Edit the `filterText` initial value from `useState('')` to `useState('fruit')` in the sandbox code below. You‚Äôll see both the search input text and the table update:

      ) === -1
    ) {
      return;
    }
    if (inStockOnly && !product.stocked) {
      return;

Notice that editing the form doesn‚Äôt work yet. There is a console error in the sandbox above explaining why:

Console

You provided a \`value\` prop to a form field without an \`onChange\` handler. This will render a read-only field.

In the sandbox above, `ProductTable` and `SearchBar` read the `filterText` and `inStockOnly` props to render the table, the input, and the checkbox. For example, here is how `SearchBar` populates the input value:

    function SearchBar(         placeholder="Search..."/>

However, you haven‚Äôt added any code to respond to the user actions like typing yet. This will be your final step.

Step 5: Add inverse data flow[](#step-5-add-inverse-data-flow "Link for Step 5: Add inverse data flow ")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently your app renders correctly with props and state flowing down the hierarchy. But to change the state according to user input, you will need to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in `FilterableProductTable`.

React makes this data flow explicit, but it requires a little more typing than two-way data binding. If you try to type or check the box in the example above, you‚Äôll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional. By writing `<input value= />`, you‚Äôve set the `value` prop of the `input` to always be equal to the `filterText` state passed in from `FilterableProductTable`. Since `filterText` state is never set, the input never changes.

You want to make it so whenever the user changes the form inputs, the state updates to reflect those changes. The state is owned by `FilterableProductTable`, so only it can call `setFilterText` and `setInStockOnly`. To let `SearchBar` update the `FilterableProductTable`‚Äôs state, you need to pass these functions down to `SearchBar`:

    function FilterableProductTable( />

Inside the `SearchBar`, you will add the `onChange` event handlers and set the parent state from them:

    <input   type="text"   value= />

Now the application fully works!
