Installation[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
==================================================

React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption. You can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to an HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, this section will help you get started.

### In this chapter

*   [How to start a new React project](start-a-new-react-project.html)
*   [How to add React to an existing project](add-react-to-an-existing-project.html)
*   [How to set up your editor](editor-setup.html)
*   [How to install React Developer Tools](react-developer-tools.html)

Try React[](#try-react "Link for Try React ")
---------------------------------------------

You don‚Äôt need to install anything to play with React. Try editing this sandbox!

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined "Open in CodeSandbox")

function Greeting() {
  return <h1\>Hello, </h1\>;
}

export default function App() {
  return <Greeting name\="world" />
}

You can edit it directly or open it in a new tab by pressing the ‚ÄúFork‚Äù button in the upper right corner.

Most pages in the React documentation contain sandboxes like this. Outside of the React documentation, there are many online sandboxes that support React: for example, [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/new), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/fork/react), or [CodePen.](https://codepen.io/pen?&editors=0010&layout=left&prefill_data_id=3f4569d1-1b11-4bce-bd46-89090eed5ddb)

### Try React locally[](#try-react-locally "Link for Try React locally ")

To try React locally on your computer, [download this HTML page.](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/0275b1e1518599bbeafcde4722e79ed1/raw/db72dcbf3384ee1708c4a07d3be79860db04bff0/example.html) Open it in your editor and in your browser!

Start a new React project[](#start-a-new-react-project "Link for Start a new React project ")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to build an app or a website fully with React, [start a new React project.](start-a-new-react-project.html)

Add React to an existing project[](#add-react-to-an-existing-project "Link for Add React to an existing project ")
