Stack Overflow is a popular forum to ask code-level questions or if youâ€™re stuck with a specific error. Read through the [existing questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reactjs) tagged with **reactjs** or [ask your own](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=reactjs)!

Popular Discussion Forums[](#popular-discussion-forums "Link for Popular Discussion Forums ")

There are many online forums which are a great place for discussion about best practices and application architecture as well as the future of React. If you have an answerable code-level question, Stack Overflow is usually a better fit.

Each community consists of many thousands of React users.
