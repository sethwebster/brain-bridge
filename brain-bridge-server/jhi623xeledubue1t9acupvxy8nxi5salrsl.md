React Videos[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
==================================================

Videos dedicated to the discussion of React and the React ecosystem.

React Conf 2021[](#react-conf-2021 "Link for React Conf 2021 ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### React 18 Keynote[](#react-18-keynote "Link for React 18 Keynote ")

In the keynote, we shared our vision for the future of React starting with React 18.

Watch the full keynote from [Andrew Clark](https://twitter.com/acdlite), [Juan Tejada](https://twitter.com/_jstejada), [Lauren Tan](https://twitter.com/potetotes), and [Rick Hanlon](https://twitter.com/rickhanlonii) here:

### React 18 for Application Developers[](#react-18-for-application-developers "Link for React 18 for Application Developers ")

For a demo of upgrading to React 18, see [Shruti Kapoor](https://twitter.com/shrutikapoor08)‚Äôs talk here:

### Streaming Server Rendering with Suspense[](#streaming-server-rendering-with-suspense "Link for Streaming Server Rendering with Suspense ")

React 18 also includes improvements to server-side rendering performance using Suspense.

Streaming server rendering lets you generate HTML from React components on the server, and stream that HTML to your users. In React 18, you can use `Suspense` to break down your app into smaller independent units which can be streamed independently of each other without blocking the rest of the app. This means users will see your content sooner and be able to start interacting with it much faster.

For a deep dive, see [Shaundai Person](https://twitter.com/shaundai)‚Äôs talk here:

### The first React working group[](#the-first-react-working-group "Link for The first React working group ")

For React 18, we created our first Working Group to collaborate with a panel of experts, developers, library maintainers, and educators. Together we worked to create our gradual adoption strategy and refine new APIs such as `useId`, `useSyncExternalStore`, and `useInsertionEffect`.

For an overview of this work, see [Aakansha‚Äô Doshi](https://twitter.com/aakansha1216)‚Äôs talk:

### React Developer Tooling[](#react-developer-tooling "Link for React Developer Tooling ")

To support the new features in this release, we also announced the newly formed React DevTools team and a new Timeline Profiler to help developers debug their React apps.

For more information and a demo of new DevTools features, see [Brian Vaughn](https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn)‚Äôs talk:

### React without memo[](#react-without-memo "Link for React without memo ")

Looking further into the future, [Xuan Huang (ÈªÑÁéÑ)](https://twitter.com/Huxpro) shared an update from our React Labs research into an auto-memoizing compiler. Check out this talk for more information and a demo of the compiler prototype:

### React docs keynote[](#react-docs-keynote "Link for React docs keynote ")
