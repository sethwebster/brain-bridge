React Developer Tools[](#undefined "Link for this heading")

*   How to install React Developer Tools

Browser extension[](#browser-extension "Link for Browser extension ")
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The easiest way to debug websites built with React is to install the React Developer Tools browser extension. It is available for several popular browsers:

*   [Install for **Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
*   [Install for **Firefox**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)
*   [Install for **Edge**](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/react-developer-tools/gpphkfbcpidddadnkolkpfckpihlkkil)

Now, if you visit a website **built with React,** you will see the _Components_ and _Profiler_ panels.

### Safari and other browsers[](#safari-and-other-browsers "Link for Safari and other browsers ")

For other browsers (for example, Safari), install the [`react-devtools`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-devtools) npm package:

    # Yarnyarn global add react-devtools# Npmnpm install -g react-devtools

Next open the developer tools from the terminal:

    react-devtools

Then connect your website by adding the following `<script>` tag to the beginning of your websiteâ€™s `<head>`:

    <html>  <head>    <script src="http://localhost:8097"></script>

Reload your website in the browser now to view it in developer tools.

Mobile (React Native)[](#mobile-react-native "Link for Mobile (React Native) ")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

React Developer Tools can be used to inspect apps built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) as well.

The easiest way to use React Developer Tools is to install it globally:

    # Yarnyarn global add react-devtools# Npmnpm install -g react-devtools

Next open the developer tools from the terminal.

    react-devtools

It should connect to any local React Native app thatâ€™s running.

> Try reloading the app if developer tools doesnâ€™t connect after a few seconds.
